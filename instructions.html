    <h1><center><b>Hints, Tips and Easter Eggs</b></center></h1>
    <div class="lg">Movement plays a critical role in the game. Having a good movement pattern can be the reason for life and death. By moving well you can evade attacks and attack more easily.</div>
    <div class="ng">When untouched in battle, Link is able to shoot a sword beam which deals a ton of damage, be warned though that this can only occur when Link has full hp. Any damage will prevent him from using this skill.</div>
    <div class="cg">Make sure to take notice of the color difficulty of an enemy. Red is the weakest while blue is the strongest. Be wary of the blue colored enemy’s in the early game as they are very strong.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="ln">Bushes and are able to be burned with a candle and some walls can be blown up with bombs. Some of these obstacles have hidden treasures…</div>
    <div class="tn">Players suggest always picking the heart container over the blue potion as you will permanently gain health with the heart container whereas you can only heal yourself with the blue potion.</div>
    <div class="cn">Be very careful of the creature that can eat armor. It can de-equip armor from your person so make sure to check your equipment when fighting this foe.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="le">Buying a bigger shield can really help against enemies who deal splash damage. Players recommend buying a good shield whether it be early or late into your game.</div>
    <div class="ne">More of an easter egg than a hint, this little trick allows you to STEAL an item from the shop. To do this you must make the owner face the wall and quickly run past him with the desired item. Be warned though, you will be branded as a THIEF and whatever you do, do not re-enter the store…</div>
